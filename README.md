Stock Market Prediction ML Project By Garima Sharma

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. 
The datasets are taken from Kaggle.com and data visualization using Matplotlib is done to analyze different aspects of the data. The risks of a stock are  based on analysing its previous performance history. Future stock prices are predicted through a Time Series Forcasting method, `ThetaForcaster`, using `sktime` library.
